## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements
- Receive an error message when the form is submitted if:
  - The `Email address` field is empty should show "Oops! Please add your email"
  - The email is not formatted correctly should show "Oops! Please check your email"

## My process

I have started from mobile, however I have realised too late that I was ONLY making it for mobile and had to rewrite a loooot of code. First time doing mobile first, will take this an en experience

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first 



### What I learned

- Learned that .value had to be insert in the eventListener function and NOT saved as a constant as it would not work. 
- Form validation with Javascript


### Continued development

I should do more forms and diffrent form styles so to improve.
